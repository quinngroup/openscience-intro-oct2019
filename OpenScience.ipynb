    "Hwang Woo-Suk, a South-Korean researcher, started his career as a scientist after getting his PhD at Seoul National University (SNU), and specialized in the reproduction of cattle. Working with in vitro fertilization and cloning of animals for years at SNU, he became a famous scientist in South-Korea, claiming to have cloned cows and pigs and genetically engineering a pig to produce human organs (among other accomplishments). He then began research on stem cells, and acquired powerful friends in the government, most notably the president himself, apparently demonstrating how he cured a sick dog using stem cell treatment. He also gained popularity in the public by appearing in media with sensational demonstrations. This led to his research being heavily financed, through government funds and donations from the public. In 2004 and 2005, articles were published by Hwang and colleagues, and these were the first times anyone could seemingly prove having created stem cells from cloning. These articles, being published in the highly respected journal Science, and the fact that he had collaborated with Dr. Gerald Schatten (a famous American scientist) on the two papers, was evidence for his earlier unpublished experiments.

A survey showed that 30% of women said they would donate egg cells for Hwangs research."

Then, a South Korean investigative TV-show started doing research about his methods, reported that he had forced these junior scientists into donating their eggs. And that DNA-test showed that of one of the cell lines in the 2005 paper did not match the DNA of the somatic tissue donor. Science reported that a review board for Seoul National University in an investigation found out that donors had received payment for the eggs. Then, things started to fall apart. Following accusations of fabrication, Hwang informed Science that some of the pictures in the 2005 article were taken from another article (the pictures were later admitted being faked). One of Hwangs collaborators then told a news network that \"there are no cloned embryonic stem cells\". Hwang and Dr. Schatten later retracted their article from Science, stating that analyzing the data had led to the conclusion that \"the results could not be trusted\". An investigation of Hwangs work by Seoul National University concluded that large amounts of the 2005 Science paper had been fabricated."
